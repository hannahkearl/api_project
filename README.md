# api_project
My idea for this project is using the API https://zestfuldata.com/.
Using this API I want to make a web application for recipes. You can create recipes and share them publicly.
The recipes will be in multiple featured catagories and you can also find specific recipes through a search engine.
I also want to impliment a way for users to add ingredients from a recipe straight to a shopping list/cart.
You can also comment on the recipes. For example, commenting suggestions to add to the recipe or commenting pictures of the dish you made after following the recipe. I think this would be a good way for people to collaborate and see other people trying out their dishes.
There could also be a shopping spot to order kitchen utensils and appliances.
I could also use the API from https://fakestoreapi.com/ for the shopping part.
